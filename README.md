**An open-source, code-first Python toolkit for building, evaluating, and
deploying sophisticated AI agents with flexibility and control.**

Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for developers seeking fine-grained
control and flexibility when building advanced AI agents that are tightly
integrated with services in Google Cloud. It allows you to define agent
behavior, orchestration, and tool use directly in code, enabling robust
debugging, versioning, and deployment anywhere ‚Äì from your laptop to the cloud.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Versatile Tool Integration**: Utilize pre-built tools, custom functions,
  OpenAPI specs, or integrate existing tools to give agents diverse
  capabilities, all for tight integration with the Google ecosystem.

- **Code-First Development**: Define agent logic, tools, and orchestration
  directly in Python for ultimate flexibility, testability, and versioning.

- **Modular Multi-Agent Systems**: Design scalable applications by composing
  multiple specialized agents into flexible hierarchies.



* **Rich Tool Ecosystem:** Equip agents with diverse capabilities using
  pre-built tools, custom Python functions, API specifications, or integrating
  existing tools.

- **Deploy Anywhere**: Easily containerize and deploy agents locally, on Cloud
  Run, or scale seamlessly with Vertex AI Agent Engine.
